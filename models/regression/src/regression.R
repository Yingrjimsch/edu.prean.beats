# features1 focuses on the intrinsic musical qualities of the tracks.

# features2 emphasize the track's presence and performance across various music platforms. 
# The inclusion in charts and playlists can significantly impact a song's streams, as it increases 
# visibility and accessibility to a wider audience. This set will help in understanding how platform 
# presence correlates with streaming numbers.

# Best Performing Model: 
# The model with features related to platform presence and performance (Features 2) outperforms the others, 
# both in terms of lower RMSE and higher R-squared. This indicates that these platform-related features are 
# more predictive of streaming numbers compared to intrinsic musical qualities.

# Importance of Platform Presence: 
# The significant impact of being present in Spotify's playlists and charts across all models highlights the 
# importance of these platforms in influencing a song's streaming success.

# Model Fit and Predictive Power: 
# While the model with only intrinsic musical features has some predictive power, its overall fit is weak. The 
# combined model does not significantly outperform the platform-focused model, suggesting that the addition of 
# intrinsic features doesnâ€™t add much predictive power beyond what is achieved by platform presence alone.
